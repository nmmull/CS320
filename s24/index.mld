{0 CAS CS 320: Concepts of Programming Languages}

{1 What is this course?}

CAS CS 320 is a course {i about} programming languages, particularly the {b design} and {b implementation} of programming languages.
In this course, we take up the "programming language" as an {i object of formal study}.
This course is {i not} about how to program, though the principles we cover are generally useful for designing and reasoning about programs.

The first part of the course is on functional programming in {{: https://ocaml.org/ }OCaml}, based on {i CS 3110: Data Structures and Functional Programming} at Cornell University and its associated {{: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html }textbook} (referred to as OCP below).
Its topics include inductive types, data abstraction, higher-order functions, combinators, and polymorphism.
It is during this part that we learn to {i think} functionally, to view programs not (necessarily) as sequences of commands manipulating some global state, but as compositions of (pure) functions which decompose and reorient data.

In the second part of the course we {i implement} an interpreter for a simple (but ultimately quite powerful) programming language.
The topics covered include parsing, syntax and semantics, variable scope and binding, storage management, and infinite data types.
After this part, you will have {i your own implementation} of a programming language for which you can write and run programs (pretty neat).

{2 Prerequisites}

- CAS CS 111 & 112: Introduction to Computer Science
- CAS CS 131: Combinatoric Structures
- CAS CS 210: Computer Systems

Generally speaking, you will get the most out of this course (and will have the best time of it) if you complete the 200 level courses required for the degree of computer science beforehand.
Above all, experience with a high-level programming language (like Python or Java) is essential.

{2 Requisites}

The workload for this course consists of assignments, a project, a midterm exam, and a final exam.
Your final grade in the course will be determined by the following breakdown:

- 30% Assignments (6 of 8 assignments, 5% each)
- 20% Programming project (3 parts, â‰ˆ7% each)
- 20% Midterm exam
- 30% Final exam

{1:course_info Course Information}

{2 Lectures}

Lectures are held twice a week, and the two instructors of the course will trade-off teaching one of the two lectures each week.

{2 Labs}

Labs will be held weekly by our TFs and TAs.
More detail on the nature of these labs to come.

{2 Communication}

Announcements and discussions will happen on Piazza.
If you are unfamiliar with Piazza, see their {{: https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/48000185443 }support page} for information and tutorials.
Some policies regarding the use of Piazza:
- {i Donâ€™t ask homework questions directly.} Formulate a question which will aid your understanding, and could potentially help others as well.
- {i Donâ€™t give homework solutions directly.} The answer-provider is just as culpable as the answer-receiver in cases of academic misconduct.
- {i Piazza is as useful as it is active.} We will try to answer questions on Piazza in a timely manner, but donâ€™t hesitate to answer questions yourself.

You will also be expected to periodically check this webpage for updates.

{2 Material}

The first part of the course depends on the textbook {{: https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html}OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful}.

All other course material will be made available on the courses GitHub repository (more information on this shortly).
If you are unfamiliar with git and GitHub, see the GitHub {{: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started }documentation} for information and tutorials.
We will also cover some basics in labs.

{2 Assignments}

There will be 8 graded assignments throughout the semester.
They are made available on Thursdays and are due {b the following Thursday by 11:59PM} (see the {!section-schedule} above).
Roughly half are written assignments and half are programming assignments.


Assignments will be submitted via Gradescope.
If you are unfamiliar with Gradescope, see their {{: https://www.gradescope.com/get_started }Get Started} page for more information.
{b We will drop your lowest two assignment grades} so only 6 assignments will count towards your final grade in the course.
This means {b we will not accept late homework assignments, under any circumstances.}

{2 Final Project}

Part of your final grade in the course will be determined by your completion of a final project.
The project has three parts which makes up the final three-weeks-worth of assignments.
More information about the nature of this project will be made available in the second-half of the course.

{2 Policies and Guidelines}

Please read carefully through my general BU {{: https://nmmull.github.io/policies.html}Course Policies} page.
We take all matters of student mental health and safety, inclusion, and academic misconduct extremely seriously.
