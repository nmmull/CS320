Follow the opam documentation instructions on <a href="https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html">How to install opam</a> for your OS. In short, use one of the following commands:</p><pre class="language-text"><code># Homebrew (macOS)
brew install opam

# MacPort (macOS)
port install opam

# Ubuntu
apt install opam

# Debian
apt-get install opam

eval $(opam env)</code></pre><p><i>Note.</i> You'll need to run <code>eval $(opam env)</code> every time you open a fresh terminal.</p></li><li><p><b>Install the packages for this course.</b> You can ignore all the warnings associated with installing the course standard library. We include <a href="https://nmmull.github.io/CS320/landing/Spring-2025/Specifications/Stdlib320/index.html">documentation</a> for this library on the course webpage.

The link in the previous sentence includes instructions on how to use OCaml with VSCode.</p><p><i>Note.</i> Setting up VSCode is optional.

We'll do our best to troubleshoot any issues you run into, but it won't be a priority.</p><h2 id="assignment-workflow"><a href="#assignment-workflow" class="anchor"></a>Assignment Workflow</h2><p>Once everything is set up, working on an assignment will go roughly as follows.</p><ol><li>Sync with the course repository to get access to the assignment (see the instructions above).</li><li>Sync the environment with the course switch <code>eval $(opam env)</code>.</li><li><p>Fill in your solutions, make sure to commit your changes frequently.</p><p><i>Note.</i> You'll often have to create your own files which satisfy the specification of the assignment. You can verify that you've set everything up correctly if <code>dune build</code> doesn't show any errors when run in <code>assigns/assignX</code>.</p></li><li><p>From within the assignment <code>lib</code> directory, run <code>dune build</code> frequently to check your code.</p><p><i>Note.</i> Per the instructions on using OCaml on VSCode, you can also use</p><pre class="language-text"><code>dune build --watch --terminal-persistence=clear-on-rebuild</code></pre><p>to rebuild every time you make a change to a file. You may want to have this going in the built-in terminal of VSCode as you work.</p></li><li><p>When you get close to completing the assignment, from within the assignment directory, run <code>dune test</code> to test your code against a small test suite we've provided. This collection of tests will include some (but not all) tests used for grading.</p><p><i>Note.</i> The tests come in the form of <a href="https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/chapters/basics/expressions.html?highlight=assert#assertions">assertions</a>. This means that <b>if you fail an assertion, the following assertions will not be tested</b>. If you can comment out assertions in order to avoid testing them.</p></li><li><i>(Optional)</i> Add your own assertions to the file <code>tests/test_assignX.ml</code>.</li><li>Push your work to your private repository and submit your assignment. On Gradescope, you'll be prompted to choose a repository and a commit to submit. After submitting, you should see a message which says that your assignment was accepted along with information about some (but not all) of the tests that were run.</li></ol><h2 id="hello-dune"><a href="#hello-dune" class="anchor"></a>Hello Dune</h2><p><a href="https://dune.build">Dune</a> is a build tool for OCaml which we'll be using for the entirety of this course. To finish off the lab, we'll create a simple project using dune. This will primarily be in order to verify that everything is set up correctly.</p><ol><li><p><b>Initialize a project.</b> Open up a terminal and <code>cd</code> to a place where you want to create a dummy project. Then run</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>eval $(opam env)
dune init project hello_dune</code></pre><p>This will create a directory called <code>hello_dune</code>, a skeleton project with the following file structure:</p><pre class="language-text"><code>.
â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ dune
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.ml
â”œâ”€â”€ dune-project
â”œâ”€â”€ hello_dune.opam
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ dune
â””â”€â”€ test
    â”œâ”€â”€ dune
    â””â”€â”€ test_hello_dune.ml</code></pre><p>You can ignore most of these files for now. We'll only update the file <code>bin/main.ml</code>.</p></li><li><p><b>Verify things work.</b> <code>cd</code> into the project you just made and run:</p><pre class="language-text"><code>dune build</code></pre><p>You should see no output (you may see a progress bar). Building a project verifies that there are no type errors in your code.</p><p>Next, run:</p><pre class="language-text"><code>dune clean</code></pre><p>Building a project creates a lot of auxiliary files, and <code>dune clean</code> just deletes them all.</p><p><i>Tip.</i> If you find that your project is not building and you think it should, run <code>dune clean</code> and then <code>dune build</code> again, particularly if you change a <code>dune</code> file or the <code>dune-project</code> file (we'll talk more about this later).</p></li><li><p><b>Write a program.</b> Open the file <code>bin/main.ml</code> in your favorite editor. You should see the following:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let () = print_endline &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code></pre><p>Like with Python, there is no special &quot;main&quot; function for OCaml. Everything in <code>main.ml</code> (or any file that you've told dune is executable) is run.</p><p>Replace the contents of <code>bin/main.ml</code> with</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let hello_message = &quot;TODO&quot;
let () = print_endline hello_message</code></pre><p>making <code>TODO</code> into a phrase of your choosing. Here we are making the message printed by the program into a variable. Finally, go back to the terminal and type:</p><pre class="language-text"><code>dune exec hello_dune</code></pre><p>You should see the message that you put in your program.</p></li><li><p><b>Use Utop.</b> Utop is an interface for OCaml's toplevel, like Python's REPL. It's a standalone program, you can type in your terminal:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>utop</code></pre><p>and from there you can type in any OCaml expression followed by two semicolons <code>;;</code>, which Utop will evaluate, e.g.:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>utop # 2 + 2;;
- : int = 4</code></pre><p>When you're done, type <code>#quit</code> to leave Utop.</p><p>It's will be more common for us to use Utop via Dune so that it runs in a <em>project aware</em> way. Let's start by creating a file called <code>lib/hello_dune.ml</code> and in it write the line:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let welcome = &quot;TODO&quot;</code></pre><p>replacing <code>TODO</code> with a welcome message of your choosing. Then in your terminal (within the directory <code>hello_dune</code>) type:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>dune utop</code></pre><p>This will open Utop, but it will <em>also</em> make available any code that you've written in the <code>lib</code> directory. You can type:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>Hello_dune.welcome;;</code></pre><p>within Utop, and Utop will evaluate it to be the message you wrote. Note the capital 'H' here. <code>Hello_dune</code> is a <i>module</i> which is defined in the file <code>lib/hello_dune.ml</code> and in which the value <code>welcome</code> is defined.</p><p>The last thing we'll do is use this value in our executable program. Go back to <code>bin/main.ml</code> and replace its content with:</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let () = print_endline Hello_dune.welcome</code></pre><p>The point: the code in <code>bin/main.ml</code> can refer to the <code>Hello_dune</code> module. This is how most of our dune projects will be structured; we'll put library code in the <code>lib</code> directory and executable code in the <code>bin</code> directory (hence, the names).</p></li></ol><p>And that's it for now, you've created a dune project. For most assignments, the dune project will be given to you. As we get further into the course, we'll look at more of the files that were generated above.</p></div></body></html>
